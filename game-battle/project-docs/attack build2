Attack Phase To do

1-Player can declare an attack by selecting attacker and attacked country. 1
2-Attacker and attacked player decide how many dice to roll. 1
3-Proper number of armies are deducted from attacker/defender country during the attack(s). 2
4-If defender is conquered, attacker can move any number of its armies in the conquered country (see the Risk rules). If it
results in conquering the whole map, the attacker is declared the winner and the game ends. 1
5-Player may decide to attack or not to attack again. If attack not possible, attack automatically ends. 1
6-Implementation of an “all-out” mode, where once the attacker and attacked country have been identified, the attack
proceeds with maximum number of dice and end only when either the attacker conquers the attacked, or the attacker
cannot attack anymore.
